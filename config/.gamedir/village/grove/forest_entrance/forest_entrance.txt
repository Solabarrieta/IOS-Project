scarecrow: What the hell is that!
Tinman: I am tinman, I was created by some people that used me as an experiment. Actually, in their words, I'm a piece of tin that has no use and no importance.
scarecrow: oh that must have hurt. 
Tinman: Not really, nothing can hurt me, i'm made of tin and i have no heart, so some people say i'm indestructible. 
dog: <tries to bit he Tinman>.
Tinman: Hey buddy, you can hurt me but thatâ€™s not gentle.
Name.c: We are trying to get to the Admin to ask our desires, you could come with us to get your heart.
Tinman: Is that even possible?... I have calculated the probability of achieving that aim and its less than 0.0001%. badwitch will find us before getting that. I think that having a heart will just make me weaker and easier to beat. I told you I'm almost indestructible like this.
goodwitch: << Your mission now is to convince TINMAN to stay with you, honey >>.
goodwitch: << Do your best convincing him, he's a hard rival >>.
goodwitch: << da'da >>.
