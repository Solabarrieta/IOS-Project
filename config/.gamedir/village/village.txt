Goodwitch: Hello to this strange world called Terminal! You have just arrived from your real world to this one, because Badwitch wants to get those fantastic shoes to destroy your home, your fantastic and loved world. You must continue the YELLOW path to arrive at ADMIN to be able to destroy Badwitch, and when you get that you will be able to get your most admired desire, be able to get back to your admired world. To start your trip, you can use the command cd in order to move around different places and also you can use ls to watch which places are available. The use of cd is cd LOCATION, where LOCATION is a place adjacent to the playerâ€™s current location. You and Dog will have a long journey to ADMIN, remember if you want Dog to be always with you you have to use the command move to each place you wanna go. If you need to see which commands are available at any moment you can use the help command.
Badwitch: If you insert any command in an incorrect way, I will destroy your appreciated world. Take a lot of care writing those commands, MUAJAJAJA!
Goodwitch: Remember <<the terminal is dark and full of terrors>>.
