Name.c: Thatâ€™s a way of seeing it but if you think about it you could have friends if you get a heart and that's the happiest thing humans have in life. Not loving someone can be tough and quite sad, we can help you to achieve that.
Tinman: I don't need friends nor help and I'm not interested in helping anyone. Less in loving someone, love is what makes you weak, I'm sorry, well no, you don't care for me, I'm not coming with you. So as you have learned you can go to your next stop. You can have a break to eat in the trees, next to here or we could go into the Forest, which has a lot of horrors.
