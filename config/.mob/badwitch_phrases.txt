Badwitch: As I suspect you are not good enough for this world. This is the first warning, be careful because Your little lovely Dog would die if you make another mistake.
Badwitch: It’s time, you can start saying goodbye to your Dog, because it doesn’t exist anymore in this world, we advertise to you the Terminal is full of terrors. In the 3rd warning you will end up without legs making it impossible for you to continue with the game. MUAJAJAJA, so you know what to do? Please make another mistake, I will be able to take control of all the worlds.
Badwitch: Are you prepared? No more legs for you, no more adventure for you. It 's the end.
