	Add here how this code is related to what we have learned in class.
       This command is only for playability purposes, so it does not have anything to do with anything we have learnt in class. It is useful when the final battle
       arrives and the player has to defeat her before she kills her.

SEE ALSO
       touch - to create an object, make weapons and tools. Even food! This is not Harry Potter!
REPORTING BUGS
       No bugs reported so far.
