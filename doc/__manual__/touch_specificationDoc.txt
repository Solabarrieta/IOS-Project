	Add here how this code is related to what we have learned in class


SEE ALSO
       open - A system call that creates a new open file description, an entry in the system table of open files. This entry records the file offset and the file status flags. A file  descriptor  is  a  reference to one of these entries; this reference is unaffected if pathname is subsequently removed or modified to refer to a different file.  The new open  file  description  is  initially  not shared with any other process, but sharing may arise via fork(2).

REPORTING BUGS
       write down here error that you have detected in your program and you can not correct. For example if you can not guarantee the answer when the argument is a number. Do not report errors that have been considered in error control.

No error detected so far.
